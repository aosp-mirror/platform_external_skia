/**
 * Defines the space that a compute shader operates on. A problem space is logically divided into
 * abstract "work groups" (or "thread groups" in Metal/D3D12).
 *
 * The "work group count" or "global size" of the work group is a 3-dimensional number that defines
 * the size of the problem space. The user must provide the global size to define the number of
 * work groups that execute as part of a dispatch.
 *
 * The local size of a work group defines the number of parallel execution units that run in that
 * group (these are called "threads" in Metal/D3D12, "wavefronts" in OpenCL, "warps" in CUDA). The
 * local size is defined in 3 dimensions and must be determined based on hardware limitations, which
 * can be queried via Caps::maxComputeWorkgroupSize() (for each individual dimension) and
 * Caps::maxComputeInvocationsPerWorkgroup().
 *
 * The WorkgroupSize type is used to represent both global size and local size.
