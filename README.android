The Skia library is a cross-platform 2D-based renderer. The
key places to look are in the folders:

  include/  : contains public header files
  src/      : contains src code

The top level makefile is at the root: Android.mk

These files originate from an upstream repository
(skia.googlesource.com) where the project is actively developed
and maintained. As a result some files are not relevant to
Android, but make the merging process smoother.
